PROBLEM 288:

The number 6174 is known as Kaprekar's contant, after the mathematician who discovered an associated property: for all four-digit numbers with at least two distinct digits, repeatedly applying a simple procedure eventually results in this value. The procedure is as follows:

For a given input x, create two new numbers that consist of the digits in x in ascending and descending order. Subtract the smaller number from the larger number. For example, this algorithm terminates in three steps when starting from 1234:

4321 - 1234 = 3087
8730 - 0378 = 8352
8532 - 2358 = 6174
Write a function that returns how many steps this will take for a given input N.
