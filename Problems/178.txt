PROBLEM 178:

Alice wants to join her school's Probability Student Club. 
Membership dues are computed via one of two simple probabilistic games.

The first game: roll a die repeatedly. Stop rolling once you get a five followed by a six. 
Your number of rolls is the amount you pay, in dollars.

The second game: same, except that the stopping condition is a five followed by a five.

Which of the two games should Alice elect to play? Does it even matter?
Write a program to simulate the two games and calculate their expected value.
