PROBLEM 182:

A graph is minimally-connected if it is connected and there is no edge that can be removed while still leaving the graph connected. 
For example, any binary tree is minimally-connected.
Given an undirected graph, check if the graph is minimally-connected. 
You can choose to represent the graph as either an adjacency matrix or adjacency list.
