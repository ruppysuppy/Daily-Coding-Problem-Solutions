PROBLEM 97:

Write a map implementation with a get function that lets you retrieve the value of a key at a particular time.

It should contain the following methods:
* set(key, value, time): # sets key to value for t = time.
* get(key, time): # gets the key at t = time.
The map should work like this. 
If we set a key at a particular time, it will maintain that value forever or until it gets set at a later time. 
In other words, when we get a key at a time, it should return the value that was set for that key set at the most recent time.


EXAMPLE:

Example 1:
d.set(1, 1, 0) # set key 1 to value 1 at time 0
d.set(1, 2, 2) # set key 1 to value 2 at time 2
d.get(1, 1) # get key 1 at time 1 should be 1
d.get(1, 3) # get key 1 at time 3 should be 2

Example 2:
d.set(1, 1, 5) # set key 1 to value 1 at time 5
d.get(1, 0) # get key 1 at time 0 should be null
d.get(1, 10) # get key 1 at time 10 should be 1

Example 3:
d.set(1, 1, 0) # set key 1 to value 1 at time 0
d.set(1, 2, 0) # set key 1 to value 2 at time 0
d.get(1, 0) # get key 1 at time 0 should be 2
