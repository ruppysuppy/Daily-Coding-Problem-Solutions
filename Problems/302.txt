PROBLEM 302:

You are given a 2-d matrix where each cell consists of either /, \, or an empty space. Write an algorithm that determines into how many regions the slashes divide the space.

For example, suppose the input for a three-by-six grid is the following:

\    /
 \  /
  \/
Considering the edges of the matrix as boundaries, this divides the grid into three triangles, so you should return 3.
