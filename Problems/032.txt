PROBLEM 32:

Suppose you are given a table of currency exchange rates, represented as a 2D array. Determine whether there is a possible arbitrage.
Arbitrage: whether there is some sequence of trades you can make, starting with some amount A of any currency, so that you can end up with some amount greater than A of that currency.
There are no transaction costs and you can trade fractional quantities.


EXAMPLE:

Input = [[1, 2], 
        [0.5, 1]]
Output = False
