PROBLEM 330:

A Boolean formula can be said to be satisfiable if there is a way to assign truth values to each variable such that the entire formula evaluates to true.

For example, suppose we have the following formula, where the symbol ¬ is used to denote negation:

(¬c OR b) AND (b OR c) AND (¬b OR c) AND (¬c OR ¬a)
One way to satisfy this formula would be to let a = False, b = True, and c = True.

This type of formula, with AND statements joining tuples containing exactly one OR, is known as 2-CNF.

Given a 2-CNF formula, find a way to assign truth values to satisfy it, or return False if this is impossible.
