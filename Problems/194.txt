PROBLEM 194:

Suppose you are given two lists of n points, one list p1, p2, ..., pn on the line y = 0 and the other list q1, q2, ..., qn on the line y = 1. 
Imagine a set of n line segments connecting each point pi to qi. 
Write an algorithm to determine how many pairs of the line segments intersect.
