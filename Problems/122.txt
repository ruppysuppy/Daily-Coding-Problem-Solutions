PROBLEM 122:

You are given a 2-d matrix where each cell represents number of coins in that cell. 
Assuming we start at matrix[0][0], and can only move right or down, find the maximum number of coins you can collect by the bottom right corner.


EXAMPLE:

Input  [[0, 3, 1, 1],
        [2, 0, 0, 4],
        [1, 5, 3, 1]]
Output = 12 (0 + 2 + 1 + 5 + 3 + 1 = 12 coins)
