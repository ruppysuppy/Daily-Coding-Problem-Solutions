PROBLEM 72:

In a directed graph, each node is assigned an uppercase letter. 
We define a path's value as the number of most frequently-occurring letter along that path. 
For example, if a path in the graph goes through "ABACA", the value of the path is 3, since there are 3 occurrences of 'A' on the path.

Given a graph with n nodes and m directed edges, return the largest value path of the graph. 
If the largest value is infinite, then return null.

The graph is represented with a string and an edge list. 
The i-th character represents the uppercase letter of the i-th node. 
Each tuple in the edge list (i, j) means there is a directed edge from the i-th node to the j-th node. 
Self-edges are possible, as well as multi-edges.


EXAMPLE:

Input = ABACA, [(0, 1),
                (0, 2),
                (2, 3),
                (3, 4)]
Output = 3 <using the path of vertices [0, 2, 3, 4], (A, A, C, A)>

Input = A, [(0, 0)]
Output = None (since we have an infinite loop)
