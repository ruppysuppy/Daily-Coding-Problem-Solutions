PROBLEM 304:

A knight is placed on a given square on an 8 x 8 chessboard. It is then moved randomly several times, where each move is a standard knight move. If the knight jumps off the board at any point, however, it is not allowed to jump back on.

After k moves, what is the probability that the knight remains on the board?
