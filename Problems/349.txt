PROBLEM 349:

Soundex is an algorithm used to categorize phonetically, such that two names that sound alike but are spelled differently have the same representation.

Soundex maps every name to a string consisting of one letter and three numbers, like M460.

One version of the algorithm is as follows:

Remove consecutive consonants with the same sound (for example, change ck -> c).
Keep the first letter. The remaining steps only apply to the rest of the string.
Remove all vowels, including y, w, and h.
Replace all consonants with the following digits:
b, f, p, v -> 1
c, g, j, k, q, s, x, z -> 2
d, t -> 3
l -> 4
m, n -> 5
r -> 6
If you don't have three numbers yet, append zeros until you do. Keep the first three numbers. Using this scheme, Jackson and Jaxen both map to J250.
