PROBLEM 112:

Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree. 
Assume that each node in the tree also has a pointer to its parent.
According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: 
"The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T that has both v and w as descendants.
(where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself)"
