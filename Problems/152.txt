PROBLEM 152:

You are given n numbers as well as n probabilities that sum up to 1. 
Write a function to generate one of the numbers with its corresponding probability.
You can generate random numbers between 0 and 1 uniformly.


EXAMPLE:

Input = [1, 2, 3, 4], [0.1, 0.5, 0.2, 0.2] 
Output = your function should return 1 10% of the time, 2 50% of the time, and 3 and 4 20% of the time.
