PROBLEM 55:

Implement a URL shortener with the following methods:
* shorten(url), which shortens the url into a six-character alphanumeric string, such as zLg6wl.
* restore(short), which expands the shortened string into the original url. 
If no such shortened string exists, return null.

Hint: What if we enter the same URL twice?
