PROBLEM 132:

Design and implement a HitCounter class that keeps track of requests (or hits). 

It should support the following operations:
* record(timestamp): records a hit that happened at timestamp
* total(): returns the total number of hits recorded
* range(lower, upper): returns the number of hits that occurred between timestamps lower and upper (inclusive)

Follow-up: What if our system has limited memory?
