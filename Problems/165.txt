PROBLEM 165:

Given an array of integers, return a new array where each element in the new array is the number of smaller elements to the right of that element in the original input array.


EXAMPLE:

Input = [3, 4, 9, 6, 1]
Output = [1, 1, 2, 1, 0]
(There is 1 smaller element to the right of 3
There is 1 smaller element to the right of 4
There are 2 smaller elements to the right of 9
There is 1 smaller element to the right of 6
There are no smaller elements to the right of 1)
