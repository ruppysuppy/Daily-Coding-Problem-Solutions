PROBLEM 1:

There exists a staircase with N steps, and you can climb up either 1 or 2 steps at a time. 
Given N, write a function that returns the number of unique ways you can climb the staircase. The order of the steps matters.

What if, instead of being able to climb 1 or 2 steps at a time, you could climb any number from a set of positive integers X? 
For example, if X = {1, 3, 5}, you could climb 1, 3, or 5 steps at a time.


EXAMPLE:

input = 4
output = 5
(
The possible ways being:
1, 1, 1, 1
2, 1, 1
1, 2, 1
1, 1, 2
2, 2
)
