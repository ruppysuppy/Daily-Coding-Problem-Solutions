PROBLEM 318:

You are going on a road trip, and would like to create a suitable music playlist. The trip will require N songs, though you only have M songs downloaded, where M < N. A valid playlist should select each song at least once, and guarantee a buffer of B songs between repeats.

Given N, M, and B, determine the number of valid playlists.
