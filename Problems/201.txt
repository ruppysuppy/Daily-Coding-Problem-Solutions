PROBLEM 201:

You are given an array of arrays of integers, where each array corresponds to a row in a triangle of numbers. 
We define a path in the triangle to start at the top and go down one row at a time to an adjacent value, eventually ending with an entry on the bottom row. 
The weight of the path is the sum of the entries.
Write a program that returns the weight of the maximum weight path.


EXAMPLE:

Input = [[1], [2, 3], [1, 5, 1]]
(represents the triangle:
  1
 2 3
1 5 1)
Output = 9 (1 -> 3 -> 5)
