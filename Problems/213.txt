Problem 213:

Given a string of digits, generate all possible valid IP address combinations.
IP addresses must follow the format A.B.C.D, where A, B, C, and D are numbers between 0 and 255. 
Zero-prefixed numbers, such as 01 and 065, are not allowed, except for 0 itself.


EXAMPLE:

Input = "2542540123"
Output = ['254.25.40.123', '254.254.0.123']
