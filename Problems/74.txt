PROBLEM 74:

Suppose you have a multiplication table that is N by N. 
That is, a 2D array where the value at the i-th row and j-th column is (i + 1) * (j + 1) (if 0-indexed) or i * j (if 1-indexed).
Given integers N and X, write a function that returns the number of times X appears as a value in an N by N multiplication table.


EXAMPLE:

N = 6, X = 12
Output = 4 (since the multiplication table looks like this:
1	2	3	4	5	6
2	4	6	8	10	12
3	6	9	12	15	18
4	8	12	16	20	24
5	10	15	20	25	30
6	12	18	24	30	36
And there are 4 12's in the table)
